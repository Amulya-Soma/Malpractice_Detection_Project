# Malpractice_Detection_Project
**Abstract:**
With the rise of online education due to the COVID-19 pandemic, students have adapted to taking online exams with manual proctoring via video communication platforms like Zoom and MS Teams. However, as online exam malpractices increase, traditional invigilation methods are becoming less effective. To address this, we developed a Neural Network model that uses the student's camera to detect malpractice during exams. The model analyzes factors such as posture, the presence of multiple individuals in the frame, and the use of electronic devices like mobile phones and laptops.

We evaluated several models, including ImageNet, VGG19, Inception V3, Xception, and MobileNet V2. After a comparative analysis, we found that MobileNet V2 achieved the highest accuracy of 92%. Additionally, we experimented with different activation functions—Single Layer, Sigmoid, Tanh, and ReLU—finding that ReLU provided the best results for the image dataset.
